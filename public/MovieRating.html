<h1>Top 3 Movies According to Karthick</h1>
<h2>My top 3 Movie of all time</h2>
<hr>
<h3>3</h3>
<p> I feel this movie touched my heart on the romantic portions of love and how the hero tries to kll himself inorder to save the heroine.</p>
<h3>Stranger Things</h3>
<p>This is not a movie but a web serires.<br />This is the first series me and my wifey spend a lot of time together to watch and enjoy.<br /> We are still waiting for the final part.<br /></p>
<h3>Family Guy</h3>
<p>This is again a web serires but for kids.<br /> I like this a lot to forgot my stress and laugh or enjoy without any thoughts. <br />
The reason i like this is because the guy "Peter griffin" in this series, enjoys life like <br />no one else has befor and he dont listen to anyone
